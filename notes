You are super. Now lets start to write a code for translating component. please act like senior ui/ux designer. 

I wanna create a component for translating. I wanna make it look like this.

1 - Top of the screen should be two dropdown for searching the language. ['en'->['es']] For example.
2 - TextInput for typing the text to translate.
3 - Sound icons, which will play the text, when you click on it.
4 - Favorite icon, which will add the words to favorites.
5 - Cancel icon, which will close the component.
6 - In Header section, favorite icon for going to the favorites screen.


This is my mind, which form do you think, you can create this component.
